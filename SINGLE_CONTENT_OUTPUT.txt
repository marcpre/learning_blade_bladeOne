<ul><li>Insert Randomly here advantages/disadvantages</li></ul>


<h2> Operating Expenses<b></b></h2>In our profitability calculations we assume an overall price of 0.1. Hence we derive a cost base line of MiningCosts 31 . Hence the miner has MiningCosts 31 until the miner gets profitable. (as per August, 2018). Our definition of payback period is: Number of days to make your initial costs back. As crypto markets have been proven in the past to be unpredictable we can only use as current starting point the  BTC price.<p></p>
