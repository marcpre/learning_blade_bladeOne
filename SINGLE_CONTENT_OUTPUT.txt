<h2> Costs for Operating the Rig<b></b></h2>In our profitability calculations we assume an overall price of 0.1. Hence we derive a cost baseline of 1.49 . Hence the miner has 79.20076 until the miner gets profitable. (as per August, 2018). Our definition of payback period is: The time that it takes the cryptominer to make its money back in days. As crypto markets have been proven in the past to be quite volatile we can only use as current starting point the current price of BTC.<p></p>

<h2> Operating Expenses<b></b></h2>In our profitability calculations we assume an overall price of 0.1. Hence we derive a cost baseline of 1.49 . Hence the miner has 79.20076 until the miner gets profitable. (as per August, 2018). We define 'payback period' as: The time that it takes the cryptominer to make its money back in days. As crypto markets have been proven in the past to be  fluctuating we can only use as current starting point the  BTC price.<p></p>

If you want to mine Bitcoin, you are better off buying hardware from Innosilicon. The company brought to the marketthe Antminer S9 ~13.5Th, their latest computer hardware.<br></p>
<p>The ASIC  miner A5 Dashmaster,  S11 SiaMaster,  D9 DecredMaster,  A9 ZMaster from Innosilicon was previously under the top miners on coindation.com. 
It is mining Equihash algorithm with a  maxHash-Rate of 50,000  consuming power as much as 620W.

 The model focuses on the following algorithms: Equihash. 
  You can mine with the Antminer S9 ~13.5Th the  cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Interest, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Gold, Hush, Komodo, ZClassic, Zcash, ZenCash</p><p>
